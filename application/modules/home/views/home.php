			<p>
			Since 1989 Construction Daniel Dargis Inc. helps individuals, real-estate investors, promoters and general contractors with feasibility reports and field construction management for the construction and renovation of residential and commercial projects. For the individuals, first we will visit the sites and we make sketches, plans and estimates. Then, we manage the construction sites or we assist, supervise and help the general contractor that has been selected for the project. We help general contractors to get contracts and projects through referrals coming from the demands of our clients. In addition, for the entrepreneurs, real-estate investors and promoters we help them get and sell their lands and projects, do engineering and architecture drawings and to start in business through many services offered by the Construction Business Center in Montreal CONSTRUCTIONBUSINESSCENTER.COM. In Montreal we are the experts in construction and renovation.
